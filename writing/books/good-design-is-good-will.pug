                        Originally written in reaction to poor design decisions by major corporations, this small pamphlet was printed and distributed through Yale University Press in 1987 and later edited and reproduced in &quot;Design Form and Chaos&quot; in 1993.

                        In it, Rand discusses corporate design decisions and how they can impact their bottom line.

                        Special thanks to Mario Rampone for supplying this copy.
