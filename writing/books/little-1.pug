                        This exuberant picture book was illustrated and designed Paul Rand, one of the most influential graphic designers of the twentieth century. The text Ann Rand is filled with clever wordplay and not only tells the engaging story of Little 1 and his quest for a friend, but makes learning numbers and simple addition positively fun.

                        The reprinting of this 1962 book proves that the classics can still be enjoyed by generations of children today. In LITTLE 1, young readers will gain knowledge about counting and basic addition as they follow the lonely &quot;1&quot; in his quest to find a friend. 1 meets with all of the other numerals, but none of them want an extra buddy until he meets the &quot;hoop&quot; known as zero. Zero is lonely too, but together they become a &quot;10.&quot;

                        &copy; 1962 by Ann Rand Ozbekhan and Paul Rand.
