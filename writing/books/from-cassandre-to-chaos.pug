                        8.5 x 10.75 hardcoverbook with 164 pages, 94 halftone illustrations and 8 color plates. Trilingual edition, with French and Spanish translations.

                        This is — quite possibly — the most desireable Graphic Design book ever published. After a decade of establishing himself as the wunderkind of the emerging field of Graphic Design, Paul Rand sat down to codify his beliefs and working methodolgy into a single volume. Thoughts on Design was the result.

                    .footnote — Randall Ross of modernism101.com

                    p.sans-serif.text-bold-italic.small-mb0 From the dust jacket:
                    p.text-italic “Rand is aware of the complexity of the designer’s function: he stresses this again and again. He has no patience with slickness, with facility; he is a severe critic of the hackneyed and the insincere. All this is dead wood to be cleared away.”
