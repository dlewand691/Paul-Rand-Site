                        Steven Heller is a legend in the world of design and his influence on the industry cannot be overstated. When CreativeLive visited Heller in his NYC studio, we talked about his life-long passion for design and why history matters.   

                        Heller has authored more than 170 books on design-related topics and the list continues to grow. In this candid conversation, Heller discusses the logos of legendary designer Paul Rand and why design literacy is important. He talks about the role of history in a contemporary designer’s work and how being well-versed in what came before you yields better results.
