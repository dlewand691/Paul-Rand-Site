                        Best-known for his corporate brand logos and art direction, Paul Rand (1914–1986) transformed commercial art from craft to profession, introduced European design standards to American commercial art, influenced the look of advertising and book design, and altered the ways in which major corporations including IBM, UPS, and Westinghouse did business. His adherence to a strict design form in his work for corporate clients was balanced by a playful side, captured in this spirited collection of literal (and figural) back-of-the-envelope sketches, doodles, notes, and imaginative sparks that later found their full form in his children’s books, logos, and personal work.

                        Steven Heller is the foremost expert on Paul Rand. He was an art director at the New York Times, where he now writes the Visuals column, and currently serves as co-chair of the MFA Design Department at the School of Visual Arts in New York.
