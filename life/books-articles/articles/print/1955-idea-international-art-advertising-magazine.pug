                        Takashi Miyayama [Editor] and Hiroshi Ohchi [Art Director]: IDEA: INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING ART. Tokyo: Seibundo- Shinkosha, 1955 [Vol. 2, no. 9, January 1955]. Original edition. Parallel texts in Japanese and English. Perfect-bound and stitched thick printed wrappers. 92 pp. Well illustrated in black and white. 4 pages in full color. Light wear overall, with a sun-faded spine and edges. Interior unmarked and very clean. Out-of-print and rather uncommon. Cover design by Paul Rand.  A very good copy.

                        8.25 x 12 perfect-bound magazine with 92 pages of editorial and advertising showcasing the state of the Graphic Arts in Japan, circa 1955. Idea served as the Japanese equivalent of Graphis â€” a magazine dedicating to promoting the Graphic Arts of a certain region to the rest of the world. Idea offers the contemporary viewer a glimpse into Japanese Graphic Design Culture as it emerged from the ashes of World War II and made its influence felt on a global scale.

                        *Idea* promoted the best and brightest Japanese Graphic Designers, and also provided lavish coverage of international designers such as Kurt Weidemann and George Him.
