                        We kick off our Standing-Room Only Lectures with this short talk by Chris Pullman, titled above and subtitled "A personal view of the interests and influences that shaped the memorable logos, witty advertising, and insightful writing of one of the most influential designers of the twentieth century."

                        A former vice president of design for WGBH and a Senior Critic in Yale's graphic design program, Pullman will offer a glimpse into the studio where Paul Rand set out to make things—a space that was loaded with forensic evidence of the inspirations and influences that provided the context from which his delightful and innovative work emerged.
