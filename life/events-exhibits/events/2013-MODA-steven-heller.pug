                        Steven Heller visited Atlanta for a special evening to discuss his relationship with Paul Rand in conjunction with the exhibit *Paul Rand: Defining Design*, exhibiting at The Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA) and curated by Daniel Lewandowski.

                        Speaking to a sold-out crowd of over 200 people at the High Museum of Art‘s Hill Auditorium, Heller reminisced about Rand’s influence and even shared some never-before-seend examples of his early work including packaging for a soap manufacturer and a whimsical mug for Blatz Beer.

                        Afterwards, he returned to the exhibit for a breif tour and socializing.

                        Special thanks to MODA and Portfolio Center for coordinating and sponsoring the event.
