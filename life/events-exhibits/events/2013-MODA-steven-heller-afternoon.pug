                        Steven Heller visited Atlanta for an afternoon speaking engagement primarily to students and educators. With over 200 people in attendance, the crowd was treated to Mr. Heller’s discussion on typography, style, aesthetics and more. 

                        Afterwards he visited the Paul Rand exhibit and prepared for his evening speech. These two visits were the highlight of the exhibit and Mr. Heller thoroughly enjoyed his time visiting. 

                        Special thanks to Portfolio Center and MODA for organizing both events.
