                                **Design Standards for USSB New Logo:**

                                + Pantone Yellow 108 is the official color for the new USSB logo.

                                + When necessary, Pantone cool gray may be substituted for the yellow; for newspaper use, a screen of black or, alternatively,white will suffice.

                                + The background should be simple, avoiding conspicuous patterns such as stripes, dots, flowers, or other ornaments.

                                + Size of the logo will depend on the function of the printed piece. Judgement should always be exercised. Logos that are too small appear superfluous; too large are irritating to the viewer.

                                + Logo should be dear of any unrelated pictorial or typographic material.

                                + Logo should always look functional and useful, and not merely decorative. The correct proportion is always a matter of contrast, sensitivity, and good design and business judgement.

                                + At the introduction of any new design, emphasis should always be given to the logo until it becomes familiar to the general audience.

                                + A logo is a silent salesman and a powerful business companion. Therefore, it is essential that it is always shown with great care and dignity.

                                + The effectiveness and longetivity of a logo is largely dependent on how well its implementation is policed. Such an operation is not simply a question of dictatorship but of understanding.

                                + The ultimate appearance of the new USSB logo may not be altered or distorted in any way for print or TV.
